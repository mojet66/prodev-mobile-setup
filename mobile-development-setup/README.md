## Setup Process for Installing Expo Go

1. I downloaded and install Expo Go from Google Play Store in my adrios device.
2. I signed in by registering with my email, username and password.
3. I initialized a new Expo project using the latest Expo Router template: npx create-expo-app@latest and named my app "prodev-mobile-app-0x00".
4. I opened app/(tab)/index.tsx, located the default text 'Welcome' and changed it to 'First App Created'.
5. I started the Expo development server with:npx expo start and scaned the QR code using Expo Go App using my device camera
6. I ran the reset command with: npm run reset-project
